## ClubMan - Happy to be alive :)

The Commander is a rare but forceful personality type with a strong affinity for logic and creativity. Commanders use their drive, determination, and sharp minds to achieve their goals. But simply achieving goals isn't enough â€“ their keen minds are always striving for ways to do it faster, better, and stronger.
